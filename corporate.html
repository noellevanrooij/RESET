      <h2 class="fw-bolder">Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>For our social media campaign, we wanted to clearly articulate our brand vision. There are already a lot of beer brands on the market, and by making our vision clear, we wanted to stand out. In addition, all our visuals are black and white, which greatly strengthens our brand identity. However, we have mainly focused our visuals on looking good. The important information and the message we want to convey are always put in the caption below the visual. We find it important that when a potential follower looks at our account, he is addressed by our so-called 'feed'. We have designed this as a kind of puzzle, where all the posts fit together nicely and together form a large image. Furthermore, we try to inspire our (potential) followers with the text under the picture and we repeatedly use the hashtags #RESET and #VERSTANDOPNUL. These are complemented by a lot of beer-related hashtags.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have a black and white square emoji repeatedly recurring to create recognizability and leave our (potential) followers in a bit of a mystery, he/she may wonder what these emojis mean and therefore stay intrigued.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Below we have described our reach objectives: Within 2 months of launching the company, we want at least 100 followers on social media and at least 600 impressions on our posts. We want to achieve these objectives by following people who fall within our target group. By doing this we attract attention and have a chance that these people will follow us back. By using the hashtags, we can achieve the engagement goal. </p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>We learned a lot during the creation and execution of this campaign. As a first example, perhaps we should have used another social media platform such as TikTok. We deliberately chose not to be able to focus on one platform, but it would probably be better to spread out.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the communication of a clear, yet mysterious message went very well. In the captions, there is a lot of information and context about the brand, while the visuals remain mysterious and make the follower curious.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, we did not achieve the objectives we wanted, but we can only learn from this. Perhaps if we were to spread the campaign over a longer period, we could acquire more followers and engagement. Despite that, we still got likes from people in the beer industry on Instagram. We expect this is due to our use of hashtags. So, all in all, hashtags are a great way to reach your target audience. </p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>If we were to continue this campaign, there are some things we would like to do differently.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>First, we would expand to an additional platform, which would be TikTok. This would allow us to create even more engagement and recognition.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We would also like to focus more on posting stories on Instagram, perhaps this can be done by reposting our TikTok’s to our Instagram story. This helps to direct our Instagram followers to TikTok and to build an audience on TikTok as well.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Another good addition to our Instagram campaign would be running advertisements. To do this, we would choose our most 'ad-proof' post and push it as an advertisement for a few days or even weeks. Instagram allows you to choose very precisely which target group you want to reach with these ads, so it would be very effective.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When we talk about what we would do differently for the marketing assignment, we think of our planning. We were only able to run our campaign for a few days, which didn't give us all the insights we needed. This is important for improving/adapting your campaign though, so we would do this differently next time. </p>
